# How to learn

## Active recall

- Create Flash card
One side is the new word, name of the topic...
The other side is the definition, example...
- Then make a question
Imagine you are being asked by someone else, like in an inteview
Make a question for yourself (what, why, how)
- Presentation
Answer your own question above like you are in a presention. If possible, make slides for your topic

## Spaced repitition

Review your knowledge (flashcard) *just often enough*, maybe after a few days. Don't do it everyday
When you review, please make sure to make questions and answer them.
