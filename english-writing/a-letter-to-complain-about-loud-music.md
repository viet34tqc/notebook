Dear Mr.A

My name is Viet and I moved to your apartment last week. I'm really happy with the apartment facilities. There is nothing to complain about it.
However, I have a problem with the loud music in the room 102. This neighbour often plays music so loudly late at night. I have made some several attemps to get him to stop but it hasn't worked. He promised to stop but keep playing loud next day.
My company starts at 7 a.m so I have to go to bed early to get to work on time. But this loud music is pretty annoying and I can't have a good sleep.
I would be very grateful if you can ask him not to play music late at night. I'm sure this is not just for me but also for other neighbours who also need to sleep

Best regards

Dear Mr.A

I'm writing to you to complain about the music coming from the neighbour's apartment every night. This music is very loud and sometimes does not stop until 3 a.m

I have asked my neighbour several times to stop the music after 11 p.m, or at least to turn it down to a reasonable level. He always apologizes and promises to be quieter, but then repeats his actions the following night.

I'm a student, as you know, I start my days early. It's very hard for me to concentrate on my studies when I do not have enough sleep and it's impossible to sleep with that loud music on all night. Some of my teachers have even noticed a drop in my performance due to fatigue

I hope you can do something about this situation. Please aks the tenant in apartment 501 to stop playing loud music after 11 p.m. If this situation keeps going, I will have no choice but to move out and demand a full refund of my rent and deposit.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter

Best regards
