### My own

Dear MrA

I'm writing to tell you about my experience with the new sofa I bought last week.

First of all, it's a nice sofa and I'm really happy with that. Furthermore, your service is really awesome. The delivery is on time and the installation is really quick and concise. Despite the fact that this is not an expensive furniture but your delivery person was really care about the it. He moved my furniture gently and place it in the exact conrner I want.

I really want to rate your service a 5-star but I didn't see anywhere to apply my rate. Please respond me if you want me to rate your service again.

Best regards,

#### Example 1

To whom it may concerns

I am writing to notify you about the terrible service your company provided as well as the totally unprofessional and incompetence attitude of your delivery person.

Last week, I ordered a new sofa from your online catalogue. The delivery person arrived two days later than expected, without any notifications. Despite being already annoyed when the delivery arrived, I was still polite and offer to help him with the sofa. He refused and proceeded to move it on his own. As a result, he scratched my floor and a couple of walls. He did not even apologize for the this. He simply set up the sofa and left. He even had the nerve to wait for a tip.

I am very angry and certainly never buy anything from your store again. At this point, however, I would like you to send me/demand a 33% refund for the sofa and the damaged caused by the delivery. If you do not positively reply to this letter, I will go to your review page and notify others customers my terrible experience.

Please respond asap. See invoice #2131 for my details.

Sincerely,

#### Example 2

Dear Acme staff,

I am writing to express my appreciation for your recent delivery. The experience was easy from start to finish and your delivery staff did a really good job.

I ordered a sofa from your online catalogue last week. It arrived after two days, as promised, and looked even better than in the picture on your website

Your delivery guys were professional and courteous. The made sure to handle the sofa carefully so as not to make any damages to my floor and wall. They set the sofa where I asked and collected the packing material and took it with them

I love my new sofa and it looks so great in my living room. I just wanted to say thank you and definitely recommend your store to all my friends. I will certainly think of you first when I need a new furniture in the future.

Please feel free to post this letter on your reviews page.

Yours sincerely,
