# Tips to improve your writing

- Understand your readers and what they want
- Plan your writing
  - What you want to include
  - What you want to leave out
- Organise your idea into paragraph. Each paragraph for each idea
- Use shorter, simpler sentence
  - 10 => 20 words
  - Avoid conjunction and relative clause (what, why, where, and...). Consider breaking it into simpler sentence if possible
  - Remove unnecessary words: 'Maybe it will help you' => 'It might help you'
  - Cut empty word: if you can use one word, use one instead of two: as a result => consequently
  - Avoid passive voice
- After writing, you might need a tool for checking grammar and paraphrase. When learning synonyms, paraphrasing is really beneficial.
