#How to use useCallback hook

## Why we need to use useCallback
When we are in need of handling an event, we often create another function inside React funciton components. Let's say we need to handle a click event:
```javascript
function MyComponent() {
  // handleClick is re-created on each render
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Clicked!');
  };

  // ...
}
```
handleClick is a different function on every rendering of MyComponent.

Normally, the creation of this function on each rendering is not a problem. However, in some cases, you need to maintain that function between renderings:
- When the function is a dependancy of other hook, e.g `useEffect(..., [callback])`
- A function component wrapped inside `React.memo()` acceps a function as prop (Please check out the example below)

That's when the `useCallback(callbackFun, [deps]` is helpful, given the same dependency values `deps`, the hook returns (memorizes) the function ***instance*** between rendering

## Good use case

Imagine you have two components. The first is a child component that render a big list of items:
```javascript
function BigList({term, onItemClick}) {
	const items = getFromAPI(term)
	const renderedItem = items.map( item => <div onClick={onItemClick}>{item}</div>)
}
export default React.memo(MyBigList);
```
The list could be big, maybe hundred of items. To prevent useless list rendering, you wrap it into React.memo
The `term` and `onItemClick` prop is passed from its parent components:
```javascript
import {useCallback} from 'react'
function Parent() {
	const onItemClick = useCallback( (event) => {
		console.log( 'You clicked', event.currentTarget)
	}, [term])

	return (
		<BigList
			onItemClick={onItemClick}
			term={term}
		/>
	)
}
```
onItemClick is memorized by `useCallback`. As long as the `term` is the same, `useCallback` returns the same function
When Parent component re-renders, `onItemClick` remains the same and don't break the memoization of `BigList`

## Bad use case
Let's look at another example
```javascript
import { useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  // Contrived use of `useCallback()`
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    // handle the click event
  }, []);

  return <MyChild onClick={handleClick} />;
}

function MyChild ({ onClick }) {
  return <button onClick={onClick}>I am a child</button>;
}
```

In this case, `MyChild` component is light and its re-rendering doesn't create performance issue. By using `useCallback` here, you increase code complexity:
- You have to keep the deps of useCallback(..., deps) in sync with what youâ€™re using inside the memoized callback.
- You have to allocate additional memory for the dep, as well as calling the `useCallback` function

## Summary
Any optimization add complexity. Any optimization added too early is a risk because the optimized code may change many times. The appropriate use case of `useCallback` is to memorize the callbak functions that are supplied to memoized heavy child component.
