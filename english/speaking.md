- Shadowing
	- Choose a topic that interests you (not just random topic, not just random conversation that you will forget easily)
	- Put yourself in the speaker's shoes, not just mimic the voice and intonation
	- Try to read along, or summarize the idea without script
- Practice what you shadowing: You need shadowing first to get the idea, the vocab to speak yourself
	- Pick a problems, a topic, a situation that you have to think. Imagine that someone asking you a question, a topic
	- Talk about it 1-2 minutes to improve the logical thinking
	- Debates: pick a topics and talk about pros and cons
