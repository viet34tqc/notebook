- Step 1: Identify the problem
	- We need to identify the problem at high level
	- Choose the right problem to solve: we need to think that why we have to solve this problem, does it make sense.
- Step 2: Break the problem into smaller problem. Analyze the problem in details very carefully 
- Step 3: Each problem can have multiple solutions. We have to calculate the trade-off between those solution: cons and pros. We also need to consider what resources we have to see if they are available
